# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project demonstrates how to use the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify Iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** using the well-known **Iris dataset**.

## 📂 Project Description

The Iris dataset is a classic example in the field of machine learning. It contains 150 samples of Iris flowers with four features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

Using these features, this project trains a KNN classifier to predict the species of an Iris flower.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn (for model and dataset)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## 📈 Workflow
1. Load and explore the Iris dataset
2. Split the data into training and test sets
3. Train the KNN model (with `k=3`)
4. Make predictions on the test set
5. Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy score

## ✅ Results

The model achieves high accuracy and performs well at classifying the Iris species based on flower measurements.

## 🔍 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the notebook (`iris_knn_classifier.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells to see data analysis, model training, and predictions

## 📚 Dataset Source

The Iris dataset is built into the `scikit-learn` library. Originally introduced by **Ronald A. Fisher** in 1936.
